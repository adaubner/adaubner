Hello, I'm Andy.

I am currently studying Data Science & AI at Maastricht University. On top of schoolwork, I use github for my own personal projects and some larger collaborative apps.

I mostly work in Python using the discord API, pandas, sql, and several data processing libraries. But I also tinker with Java.
